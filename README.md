### Hei ðŸ‘‹

Feel free to reach me for help or collaboration.

Iâ€™m a capable software engineer with a lot of practical experience in iOS development. People appreciate my experience with and understanding of different app architectures, tools and typical dependencies. I value the practice of constant and overarching communication and teamwork. Iâ€™m trying to keep the feedback loop as short as possible.
